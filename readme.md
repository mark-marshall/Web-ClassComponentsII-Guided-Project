# How to
  * Clone repo,
  * run `npm install` to get dependencies.
  * run `npm run dev` to start webpack.
  * run `live-server` or similar to serve up `index.html`.

# Objectives
  * Class components: extending React.Component.
  * The constructor function vs. the newer `state = { // etc }` syntax.
  * Initializing state to a hard-coded object assigned outside of the component.
  * Initializing state using incoming props.
  * Conditionally initializing state to a hard-coded value or from props.
  * Updating state with setState.
  * Passing state around via props.
  * Passing callbacks around (via props) that change state.
  * Working with inputs in React.
  * Spreading props using `{...rest}`.
  * Conditionaly pass one set of props or another.
  * Rendering custom components using `.map`.
  * Create methods that update app state using callbacks, and local state using other methods.
  * Generating unique ids for our new friends.

# Steps
  * Find steps in the `.jsx` files inside `src/components` folder.

# Final App
  * Check the `lecture` branch once the lecture is done.
